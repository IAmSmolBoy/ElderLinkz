# Elderly Home Care IoT Management System Using Biosensors v2.0

### Objective 🎯

This project aims to enhanced the data acquisition system that was developed by the previous MDL MP that monitors the health of the elderly, with collected data integrated into a management dashboard.
This will allow healthcare workers to analyze the information quickly and respond to the needs of the patients. This project we plan to show to an elderly home referred by the diploma in biomedical engineering.
